              Some months ago we were convinced that this only can happen if
              people from different backgrounds and a big pile of post-its come
              together in a small team space. But the corona pandemic and all
              restrictions associated with it proved us wrong: it also works
              remotely! With the right tools, a creative and open mindset, and
              also some self-discipline you can be a high-end product team in a
              remote-setting as well! We meet at Zoom, we collaborate in Miro
              and we manage our to-dos in Jira.
