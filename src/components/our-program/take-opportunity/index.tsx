            When it comes to developing digital products, there's nothing like
            working on projects to gain this experience.  There's loads of
            methods, techniques, frameworks, tools, buzzwords, communication
            strategies.  But to reap the benefit and to see it all falling into
            place, you need to work on projects with different challenges. And
            alongside some great teammates.
