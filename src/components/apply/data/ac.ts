At DPS we focus on the team level. This is why we call the person who tries to have an impact on the social system, the  Agile Team Coach (ATC).',

    'An agile coach is an agile and lean practitioner. They know a lot about agile values and principles and this mindset guides them in a strong way, so much so that they can be a role model for others. There are lots of agile methods in their tool-box and they can, for example, easily teach a team how to make good, fast  decisions by teaching them the right tools and helping them practice.',
  firstColumn:
    'An agile coach knows exactly how to use agile frameworks and how to teach them,  for example Scrum and Kanban. They can also facilitate events like retrospectives, planning meetings  or Ideation sessions. Whenever a team is dealing with a difficult situation, the agile coach might have been in a similar situation before, so they can mentor the team and share their experiences. Like a professional coach, they ask powerful questions to assist others to discover their full potential. They know a lot about group dynamics and can help the team understand themselves and regulate itself as a team. While a mediator can assist  conflicting parties to find a resolution, the agile coach goes further by teaching the team how to resolve conflicts on their own.',

    'Of course, 3months is not enough time to become an experienced agile coach. If you apply to DPS you will get eleven weeks of experience in the role. This will be a crucial step on your way to becoming an agile coach. You will have mentors, coaches and experienced agile practitioners around you.',
