    'An agile coach is an agile and lean practitioner. They know a lot about agile values and principles and this mindset is guiding them in such a strong way, that they might become a role model for others. There are lots of agile methods in their tool-box and they can for example easily teach a team how to make fast and good decisions as a team by showing them tools and helping them practice.',
  firstColumn:
    'An agile coach knows exactly how to use and also how to teach agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban and they can facilitate events like retrospectives, plannings or ideation sessions. Whenever a team is dealing with a difficult situation, the agile coach might have been in a similar situation themself before. So they can mentor the team and share their experiences. Like a professional coach, they are  asking powerful questions to assist others to discover their full potential. They know a lot about group dynamics and can help the team to understand and regulate itself as a team. While a mediator assists disputing parties in resolving a conflict, the agile coach is going further by teaching the team how to solve conflicts on their own.',

    'Of course, three months are not enough time to become an experienced agile coach. If you apply for DPS you will get eleven weeks of experience in the role of an agile team coach.
