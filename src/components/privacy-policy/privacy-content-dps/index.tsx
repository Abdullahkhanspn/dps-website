            4. PERSONAL DATA IN THE CONTEXT OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS
          </h3>
          <p>
            a) Personal data is information about personal or factual
            circumstances of a specific or Identifiable natural person. This
            includes information such as your name, address, telephone number
            and date of birth, but also data about your specific career, etc.,
            which can be assigned to a specific person with reasonable effort.
            <br />
            b) Information that is not (un)indirectly associated with your real
            identity, on the other hand, is not personal data.
          </p>

          <h3>5. BASIS AND PURPOSES FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA</h3>
          <p>
            a) If you apply to us electronically, i.e. by e-mail or via our web
            form, we will collect and process your personal data for the purpose
            of processing the application procedure and carrying out
            pre-contractual measures.
            <br />
            b) By submitting an application on our page, you express your
            interest in participating in the respective batch of DPS In this
            context, you provide us with personal data that we use and store
            exclusively for the purpose of your application.
            <br />
            c) In particular, the following data are collected: <br />
            - Name (first and last name) <br />
            - E-mail address <br />
            - Phone number <br />
            d) You also have the option of uploading your CV and references.
            These may contain further personal data such as date of birth,
            address, etc.
            <br />
            e) Only authorized employees involved in the application process
            have access to your data.
            <br />
            f) Personal data is stored exclusively for the purpose of the
            application process and if accepted to administrate your
            participation in the batch for which you have applied for.
            <br />
            g) Your data will be stored for a period of 16 months beyond the end
            of the application process. This is usually done in order to fulfil
            legal obligations or to defend against any claims arising from legal
            regulations. Subsequently, we are obliged to delete or anonymize
            your data. In this case, the data is only available to us as
            so-called metadata without direct personal reference for statistical
            evaluations (for example, proportion of women or men in
            applications, number of applications per period, etc.).
          </p>
          <h3>6. GOOGLE FIREBASE</h3>
          <p>
            a) DPS uses the Storage module of Google Firebase (Google Inc., 1600
            Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) to update
            content.
            <br />
            b) In these cases, data can be transferred to all Google data
            centres (also in non-EU countries without an adequate level of data
            protection, in particular the USA) without appropriate safeguards
            within the meaning of Art. 46 GDPR. In its judgment of 16 July 2020,
            Case C-311/18 ("Schrems II"), the ECJ found that an adequate level
            of data protection cannot be guaranteed in the USA. On the one hand,
            there is a risk of access to the transferred data by US security
            authorities without the possibility of effective legal remedies. On
            the other hand, there are no enforceable data subject rights. The
            transfer therefore only takes place with your express consent on the
            basis of Art. 49 (1) DSGVO.
            <br />
            c) Further information on data protection in connection with Google
            Firebase can be found at:{' '}

          </p>
          <h3>7. TRELLO</h3>
          <p>
            a) We use the web-based project management tool Trello to process
            the applicants' data. We do this to store the applicants' data so
            our staff can evaluate and handle applications. This service is
            provided by Trello, Inc., 55 Broadway, 25th Floor, New York, NY
            10006, USA.
            <br />
            b) In these cases, data can be transferred to the USA - a non-EU
            country without an adequate level of data protection, the meaning of
            Art. 46 GDPR. In its judgment of 16 July 2020, Case C-311/18
            ("Schrems II"), the ECJ found that an adequate level of data
            protection cannot be guaranteed in the USA. On the one hand, there
            is a risk of access to the transferred data by US security
            authorities without the possibility of effective legal remedies. On
            the other hand, there are no enforceable data subject rights. The
            transfer therefore only takes place with your express consent on the
            basis of Art. 49 (1) a) DSGVO.
            <br />
            c) Detailed information about the collecting, processing and usage
            of the data by Trello you can find here:{' '}
