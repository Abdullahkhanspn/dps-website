            You can be the best graduate of all time. You might have worked your butt off, and undertaken the most amount of internships a student has ever done. But, when you go to your first job after uni, you're a newbie. Your business card will probably state »Junior«. As in »Not quite as experienced as the colleagues«.
            When it comes to developing digital products, there's nothing like working on projects to gain this experience. There's loads of methods, techniques, frameworks, tools, buzzwords, communication strategies. But to reap the benefit and to see it all falling into place, you need to work on projects with different challenges. And alongside some great teammates.
